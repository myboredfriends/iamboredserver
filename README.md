# iamboredserver

this project is the best thing anyone has ever come up with and this is the server that will enable the other parts of the project to function. It is 3 in the morning and i got to a point where i am not drunk but happy :)
The Idea is basically to have a easy way to know what "friends" of you are jsut as bored as you.
When I say fwends i don't mean to insult you becaus you have none, it is just a way to coin a term of other human or non human beings to hang out with.
I made some drawings to explain further, I dont want to upload them.
The rest of this is just babbeling but maybe you will get the idea.


Behold!

myboredfriends

the new way to waste your time!!!!1!!

you are alone?

you want to meet someone?

you have met people before but you don't know if they would be up to for your joint adventures?

Here is the solution

myboredfriends is the new app that you want to install and help develop!

it will give you an easy way to tell who is awake and bored

just open your client and see who seeks

basically there will be a list of people you added as contacts

everyone who set themselves as bored will show up on your device in order of distance

you can then contact them and ask if they want to meet

dont waste your time contacting users who just forgot to set as bored
there shall be a timeout of 1 h

also don't worry about privacy
there will be "no" names emails and the stuff (just some "notes") just pgp publickeys

Your friends don't know how pgp works?

Don't worry the client willhandle

How do I know my friend is bored?
The server will tell

but cant everyone see who is up when?
yes they can see what publickey is "online"

but then random people will contact me!
how? they just see your publickey that won't be bound to an email, just an ID

but everyone can set me as online and spam the system
guess the client has to sign the state update with the privkey

what does the server do?
handle requests duh...
basically keep a list of submitted keys

but then i will just but as many publickeys as i want
well that is why this is on github i need ANSWERS
maybe key timeout and validation? or sth maybe captcha?
maybe only if you get an invitation token or something?
if mods ban you your whole brach will be sawn off!

but i want my own server
that is why your contact will have a server list.. updates only manual?

so I don't undestand what you want or what this is but you are drunk and I like to support your drunken protcheckt
